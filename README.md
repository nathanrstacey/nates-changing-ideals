# Nate's Changing Ideal
## Life’s only goal 

Each of our actions revolve around finding something bigger than us to synergize all of our signals from our probes

Some background:
There are probes of many sizes that all are affected. By probes, I mean any detectable signal—internal or external—that exerts pressure on a system toward action, interpretation, or adaptation. This includes probes hitting us from all over this world, this universe, humans and animals, as well as the loudest which are in our body even down to atoms and smaller. There are many entities that try to synergize these probes. 

We think therefore we are broken. That is oversimplified but let me explain. Broken as in, we have not reached the above goal yet. Pain comes in forms that we choose (chosen) and forms we do not choose (unchosen). A common form of unchosen pain is when signals don’t synergize to us. This unchosen pain makes us think, as long as we continue to think for this reason, we are broken. It is possible this is the only reason we think, more research needs to be looked at for this

At this time there is nothing capable of fully synergizing all of our probes. Some entities will claim they can, we all have chosen entities to follow, but all fail. We know they fail because we think of unchosen pain. The more probe signals that an entity allows itself to listen to and mold itself to those signals, the better the chance that said entity can get us closer to the above goal. 

An example of an entity providing significantly more synergized success is an organ. As in, DNA within every cell tells each cell its purpose. As in, more probe synergy would make us become cells to a larger organ.

This theory is still in the works. I am not a philosopher by trade but have tens of thousands of hours researching the reasons for choices and utopian concepts. I would love opinions to help improve it 




## My Personal Mantra

To love is to let someone feel safe being themselves. Being loved is to feel safe  
Everything else is control, which is a vital part of every relationships growth, but it is control  
Bad Control happens when its hard to give the controller feedback  
Bad Control can become evil when high stakes are involved  

All anyone really wants is freedom to be their authentic self  
One way to help people have that freedom is to love
