## How to be my best person while being consistent

To love is to let someone feel safe being themselves. Being loved is to feel safe  
Everything else is control, which is a vital part of every relationships growth, but it is control  
Bad Control happens when its hard to give the controller feedback  
Bad Control can become evil when high stakes are involved  

All anyone really wants is freedom to be their authentic self  
One way to help people have that freedom is to love
